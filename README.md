This Christmas, join me to admire the magic of life by this Game of Life!

Languages: CSS, Javascript, and HTML
<br>

## Description

This Project is based on Conway's Game of Life, which mimic the rule of lives following the following rules:

<ol>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

The play can start with creating the cells (which will show up grids based on the size of the screen), create random symbosis by either click on the "GENERATE RANDOM SYMBOSIS" button or click on the cells directly. Once satisfied, click "START GAME" button and the simulation will start.
